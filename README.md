# Ngrx


NGRX store repo exploring simple CRUD actions using an ngrx store.

### Note: 

Latest update in 2022 would not work on latest node at the time ( v 17 ), so went down to 14.5 and it worked. 

Also, got an error about Typescript not understanding how to use the spread operator ( this was on a new machine), so I just did 

```
npm install tslib@latest --save 
```

and that fixed that issue.
